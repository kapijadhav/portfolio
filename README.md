## projects
### Project 1: Developing an advanced data-driven system for mortgage Fraud detection and credit risk management.

- Understand the Problem statement & Domain, and collect necessary information. Assist in data collection with the help of AWS S3 Bucket, start Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Draw Conclusions.
- perform EDA like Univariate, Multivariate analysis by Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries. check correlation.
- Assist in the development & implementation of data visualization techniques to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.
- Collaborate with senior data scientists and analysts to support data-driven decision-making processes and provide valuable insights Perform Feature Engineering for missing values treatments, Outlier Handling, Encoding, Scaling, Binning, Feature Construction, Feature selection etc.
- use various Classification models, Evaluate those models.
- Create Web Framework with Flask and check model. use Postman for Testing.
- Actively Participate in Daily/Weekly status calls. Collaborate with seniors, Implement various Techniques under their guidance.

### Project 2: Advanced NLP Techniques for Pharmacovigilance: Uncovering Customer Sentiments and Root Causes of Adverse Drug Events

- Collect data from Surveys, Google Forms, Reviews, Feedbacks.
- detect Language & Translate in English, convert in lower case with normalization then initial preprocessing is done.
- Perform EDA NGram, Word Cloud, Extracting Keyphrases here we get the insights from the Data.
- Use Yake Or Rake here we remove Language specific and Domain specific Stopwords,find the keyphrases to Perform root cause analysis.
- now preprocessing part we removing Spaces, New lines, Blank Lines, Contraction Mapping, Handled Accented Characters.
- clean the data by removing Punctuations, Stopwords, use Normalization, do Autocorrection by Autocorrect, Textblob Libraries.
- do stemming and lemmatization, and use clustering technique to get target Column and check with CountVectorizer, TFIDF, Word2Vec also evaluate cluster with silhouette score, silhouette visualizer.
- Select Proper Classification Model and Evaluate it.
- Sending the regular status to the higher authorities in a timely manner.
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to validate and refine NLP models based on domain specific knowledge and feedback from healthcare professionals.
- Participating in regular team meetings and presenting project updates.
- Collaborating with senior data scientists and researchers to contribute to the development of innovative NLP techniques and frameworks specific to pharmacovigilance and adverse drugevent detection.
